* Development

sync_songs is designed to be used as standalone and also to provide a useful library for syncing songs between different services. A goal is for sync_songs to handle any number of services and for it to be easy to add support for new services.

** General guidelines

- Document with [[http://tomdoc.org/][TomDoc]].
- If possible, include tests for every feature.
- Follow [[https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide][The Ruby Style Guide]]. This means that [[https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop][rubocop]] can be used to check style.

** TODO Project structure

Illustrate and describe file structure.

Relation between main controller, cli and entities and service controllers, clis and entities.

** TODO Services

How a service interacts with the rest of the project.

*** Adding services

A service (set) should handle its exceptions.

** Plan

The plan is for sync_songs to work as pleasantly, work as expected and have as few bugs as possible. Specific plans are documented in plan.org. Also see [[https://github.com/Sleft/sync-songs/issues][issues]].
