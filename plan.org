* Guidelines
- Structure: As Ruby gems http://stackoverflow.com/questions/614309/ideal-ruby-project-structure
- Style https://github.com/styleguide/ruby , also TomDoc forcomments.
* TODO Plan
- Use hash style parameters for initializer, see PickAxe p. 84.
  #+begin_src ruby
    def hash_parameters(params)
      # Raise error if either is not given
      unless artist = params[:artist] or puts title = params[:title]
        raise Error                 # Change to some appropriate error
      end
    end
    
    hash_parameters(:artist => "Artist", :title => "Title")
    hash_parameters(:artist => "Artist")
    hash_parameters(:title => "Title")
  #+end_src
- Use hash style parameters for =add= so that it also can have the following functionality (i.e. take artist and title rather than song as parameter):
  #+begin_src ruby
    # Public: Adds a song with the given artist and title to the list.
    #
    # artist - The artist of the song to add.
    # title  - The title of the song to add.
    #
    # Returns the song list to enable chaining of calls to this
    #   method.
    def add(artist, title)
      add(Song.new(artist, title))
    end
  #+end_src
