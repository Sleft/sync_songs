#+title: Plan

* TODO Plan
- Add changelog
- Use https://gist.github.com/fnichol/1912050
- Remove =lov = [lov] unless lov.is_a?(Array)= from last_fm_set.rb if https://github.com/youpy/ruby-lastfm/issues/52 is fixed.
- Go through all documentation and fix it.
- Fix all warnings upstream.
- Add tests for all new things.
  - Add tests for songs with album.
- Use watir for testing last.fm auth.
- Add examples to documentation as in the Tomdoc specification.
- Add argument types to documentation, from Tomdoc: "The expected type (or types) of each argument SHOULD be clearly indicated in the explanation. When you specify a type, use the proper classname of the type (for instance, use 'String' instead of 'string' to refer to a String type)."
- Make singleton classes that can carry API keys and passwords for a particular user so that one can check if such an instance is running and use it rather than asking the user for the same password again.
- Consider adding support for the following: librefm, rhythmbox, gogoyoko, jamendo.
- Use YAML.dump and lib tmpdir to store Last.fm token?
- Integrate with Travis CI to automate tests.
