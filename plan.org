#+title: Plan

* TODO Plan
- Document all methods in CLI.
- Go through all documentation and fix it.
- Go through all public methods and check interface before release.
- Add example and documentation to Structs in sync-songs.rb
- Split Controller into several classes, e.g. one for sync and one for diff?
- Add tests for all new things.
  - Add tests for songs with album.
- Use watir for testing last.fm auth.
- Use safe version operators in gemspec.
- Follow https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide and https://github.com/styleguide/ruby , also TomDoc for comments.
- Add examples to documentation as in Tomdoc specification?
- Add argument types to documentation, from Tomdoc: "The expected type (or types) of each argument SHOULD be clearly indicated in the explanation. When you specify a type, use the proper classname of the type (for instance, use 'String' instead of 'string' to refer to a String type)."
- Write a guide for adding new services.
- Make singleton classes that can carry API keys and passwords for a particular user so that one can check if such an instance is running and use it rather than asking the user for the same password again.
- Consider adding support for the following: librefm, gogoyoko, jamendo.
- Use YAML.dump and lib tmpdir to store Last.fm token?
- Include the README in the documentation of the main class.
- Use Rake to make tests http://stackoverflow.com/q/9017158/789593
- Integrate with Travis CI to automate tests.
** Gem

- Filter out relevant files for inclusion in gem via =candidates= and =Dir.glob=.
- Run tomdoc via command similar to =s.has_rdoc= and =s.extra_rdoc_files=.
